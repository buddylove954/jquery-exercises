/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Task #0

   Fill the `phrases` array with some of your favorite phrases.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

var phrases = [
    'I like pie.',
    'Add some of your own phrases here.',
    'Make sure to follow all but the last phrase with a comma.'

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Task #1

   Use jQuery to make it so that when you click the refresh button, the phrase
   currently displayed on the screen is replaced with the next one from
   the `phrases` array. When the last phrase is reached, it should start again
   from the beginning.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */


/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Task #2

   Notice how the cursor changes when you move your mouse over the phrase. Again
   use jQuery to make it so that when you click on the phrase itself it behaves
   as if the refresh button was clicked.
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */


/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Task #3

   Use jQuery to make it so that when you click the trash button, the phrase
   changes but the phrase that was just removed is also removed from
   circulation. It shouldn't appear again no matter how many times the phrase is
   changed.
